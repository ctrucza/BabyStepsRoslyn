- find methods in classes
    - find properties/variables in classes
    - in methods, find references to properties/variables
    - find all references to a property/variable
- count public/private/protected methods of classes
	- find protected non-virtual methods
    - find private methods not called
    - sort methods based on level of abstraction:
        - a method is of lower level of abstraction than it's callers
- count fields and properties in classes
	- count private and protected fields and properties
	- find provate/protected fields and properties not used in all methods
- level of abstraction: a method which calls another method is at higher level of abstraction
